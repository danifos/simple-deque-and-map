# Deque
Implemeted using a double-ended block list, which is just a common approach.

# Map
Implemented using red black tree. It's not an elegant implementation,
but all the lines containing "shit" can be removed if `erase(it++)` and `erase(it--)` are not required.

# Tips
Run `check-all.sh` and `memcheck-all.sh` to automatically test the code.
